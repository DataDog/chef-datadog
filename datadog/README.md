- chef >= 0.9

Platform
--------

* Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS

Cookbooks
---------

The following Opscode cookbooks are dependencies:

* apt
* chef_handler
* yum::epel


Attributes
==========

* `node[:datadog][:api_key]`    	= This needs to be retrieved from your Account Settings page.
* `node[:datadog][:application_key]`= There are none by default. Visit the Account Settings page to create a new Application Key, to be used in conjunction with your API key.
* `node[:datadog][:url]` 			= The location of where Datadog is hosted. Should never change.
* `node[:datadog][:repo]` 			= Where the Datadog-maintained packages are located. Should never change.
* `node[:datadog][:debug]` 			= Will trigger heavy logging to /tmp/dd-agent.log
* `node[:datadog][:use_ec2_instance_id]` = Whether to use the instance-id in lieu of hostname when running on EC2. No effect on non-EC2 servers.
* `node[:datadog][:use_mount]`      = Whether to use the mount point instead of the device name for all I/O metrics.

apache
-------
* `node[:apache][:status_url]` 		= Url to Apache's status page. Must have mod_status installed.  See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_status.html for details.

graphite
--------
* `node[:datadog][:graphite]`       = Turns the agent into a Graphite carbon relay.
* `node[:datadog][:graphite_port]`  = Port that the carbon relay will listen on.

mysql
-------
* `node[:mysql][:server]`			= MySQL host
* `node[:mysql][:user]`				= MySQL user. It only runs "SHOW STATUS" queries, which doesn't require any privileges, so you should consider creating a separate, unprivileged user.
* `node[:mysql][:pass]`				= MySQL user's password

nginx
-------
* `node[:nginx][:status_url]`		= Url to nginx's status page. Must have http_stub_status_module installed.  See http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpStubStatusModule for details.

nagios
-------
* `node[:nagios][:log_dir]`			= Path to Nagios's event log file
* `node[:nagios][:conf_dir]`		= If you use perfdata, dd-agent can import automatically and in real-time performance data collected by nagios.  For more information on perfdata configuration, please refer to http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/perfdata.html.  Path to Nagios' ***configuration*** file where the properties host|service_perfdata_file and host|service_perfdata_file_template are defined.

cassandra
-------
* `node[:cassandra][:host]`			= Cassandra host
* `node[:cassandra][:port]`			= Cassandra port
* `node[:cassandra][:nodetool]`		= Path to nodetool

java
-------
* `node[:jvm_jmx][:server]`			= JMX server:port to connect to
* `node[:jvm_jmx][:user]`			= JMX user to log in with, if needed
* `node[:jvm_jmx][:pass]`			= Password for the configured JMX user
* `node[:jvm_jmx][:name]`			= Name to report the statistics for this java VM. This will allow to monitor several JVMs running on the same machine.

tomcat
-------
* `node[:tomcat_jmx][:server]`		= host:port to connect to. Must be configured in tomcat setenv.sh or similar
* `node[:tomcat_jmx][:user]`		= JMX user to log in with, if needed
* `node[:tomcat_jmx][:pass]`		= Password for the configured JMX user

varnish

* `node[:varnish]`                  = if true, will invoke `varnishstat` on the server to gather varnish metrics.

Recipes
=======

default
-------
Just a placeholder for now, when we have more shared components they will probably live there.

dd-agent
--------
Installs the Datadog agent on the target system, sets the API key, and start the service to report on the local system metrics

dd-handler
----------
Installs the `chef-handler-datadog` gem and invokes the handler at the end of a chef run to report the details back to the newsfeed.


Usage
=====

1. Add this cookbook to your Chef Server, either by installing with knife or downloading and uploading to your chef-server with knife.
2. Add your API Key, either to `attributes/default.rb`, or by using the inheritance model and placing it on the node/
3. Upload the new recipe via: `knife cookbook upload datadog`
4. Associate the recipes with the desired `roles`, i.e. "role:chef-client" should contain "datadog::dd-handler" and a "role:somethingelse" should start the dd-agent with "datadog::dd-agent".
4. Wait until chef-client runs on the target node (or trigger chef-client if you're impatient)

We are not making use of data_bags in this recipe at this time, as it is unlikely that you will have more than 1 API key.
