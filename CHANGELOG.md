# v1.0.0 - 2013/05/06

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Moved all attributes into `datadog` namespace - #46 (#23, #26)

  Reasoning behind this was that originally we attempted to auto-detect many common attributes and deploy automatic monitoring for them.
  We found that since inclusion of the `datadog` cookbook early in the run list caused the compile phase to be populated with our defaults (mostly `nil`), instead of the desired target, and namespacing of the attributes became necessary.

* **NEW PROVIDER**: Added a new `datadog_monitor` provider for integration use

  The new provider is used in many pre-provided integration recipes, such as `datadog::apache`.
  This enables a run list to include this recipe, as well as populate a node attribute with the needed instance details to monitor the given service

* Updated dependencies in Gemfile, simplifies travis build - #34, #55
* Much improved test system (chefspec, test-kitchen) - #35 & others
* Tests against multiple versions of Chef - #18
* Added language-specific recipes for installing `dogstatsd` - (#28)
* Added ability to control `dogstatsd` from agent config via attribute - #27
* Placed the `dogstatsd` log file in `/var/log/` instead of `/tmp`
* Added attribute to configure dogstreams in `datadog.conf` - #37
* Updated for `platform_family` semantics
* Added `node['datadog']['agent_version']` attribute
* (Handler Recipe) Better handling of EC2 instance ID for Handler - #44
* Updated for agent 3.6.x logging syntax
* Generated config file removes some whitespace - #56
* Removed dependency on `yum::epel`, only uses `yum` for the `repository` recipe
