Datadog Cookbook
================

Chef recipes to deploy Datadog's components and configuration automatically.

Requirements
============
- chef >= 10.14

Platforms
---------

* Amazon Linux
* CentOS
* Debian
* RedHat
* Scientific Linux
* Ubuntu

Cookbooks
---------

The following Opscode cookbooks are dependencies:

* `apt`
* `chef_handler`
* `yum`


Recipes
=======

default
-------
Just a placeholder for now, when we have more shared components they will probably live there.

dd-agent
--------
Installs the Datadog agent on the target system, sets the API key, and start the service to report on the local system metrics

dd-handler
----------
Installs the [chef-handler-datadog](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-handler-datadog) gem and invokes the handler at the end of a Chef run to report the details back to the newsfeed.

dogstatsd-(python|ruby)
-----------------------
Installs the language-specific libraries to interact with `dogstatsd`.

other
-----
There are many other integration-specific recipes, that are meant to assist in deploying the correct agent configuration files and dependencies for a given integration.


Usage
=====

1. Add this cookbook to your Chef Server, either by installing with knife or by adding it to your Berksfile:
  ```
  cookbook 'datadog', '~> 2.0.0'
  ```
2. Add your API Key as a node attribute via an `environment` or `role` or by declaring it in another cookbook at a higher precedence level.
3. Create an 'application key' for `chef_handler` [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api), and add it as a node attribute, as in Step #2.
4. Associate the recipes with the desired `roles`, i.e. "role:chef-client" should contain "datadog::dd-handler" and a "role:base" should start the agent with "datadog::dd-agent".  Here's an example role with both recipes:
  ```
  name 'example'
  description 'Example role using DataDog'

  default_attributes(
    'datadog' => {
      'api_key' => 'api_key',
      'application_key' => 'app_key'
    }
  )

  run_list %w(
    recipe[datadog::dd-agent]
    recipe[datadog::dd-handler]
  )
  ```
5. Wait until `chef-client` runs on the target node (or trigger chef-client manually if you're impatient)

We are not making use of data_bags in this recipe at this time, as it is unlikely that you will have more than one API key and one application key.
