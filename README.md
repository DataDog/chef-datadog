Datadog Cookbook
================

Chef recipes to deploy Datadog's components and configuration automatically.

This cookbook includes support for:

* Datadog Agent version 6.0 and up: please refer to
the [dedicated section](#agent-6-support) and the [inline docs](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog/blob/v2.15.0/attributes/default.rb#L31-L75)
for more details on how to use it
* Datadog Agent version 5.x

**Log collection is now available with Agent v6, please refer to the [inline docs](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog/blob/v2.15.0/attributes/default.rb#L383-L388) to enable it.**

*Note: This README may refer to features that are not released yet. Please check the README of the
git tag/the gem version you're using for your version's documentation*

Requirements
============
- chef >= 10.14

Platforms
---------

* Amazon Linux
* CentOS
* Debian
* RedHat
* Scientific Linux
* Ubuntu
* Windows (requires chef >= 12.0)
* SUSE (requires chef >= 13.3)

Cookbooks
---------

The following Opscode cookbooks are dependencies:

* `apt`
* `chef_handler`
* `windows`
* `yum`

**Note for Chef 11 users**: please use these additional dependency version contraints for compatibility with Chef 11:

```
cookbook 'apt', '< 4.0'
cookbook 'chef_handler', '< 2.0'
cookbook 'windows', '< 2.0'
cookbook 'yum', '~> 3.0'
```

(in Berkshelf/Librarian format)

Known Issues
============

Due to a critical bug in agent versions `6.14.0` and `6.14.1` for Windows, these versions have
been blacklisted in cookbook versions `>=3.4.0`. `>=2.20.0`.

**PLEASE NOTE:** chef-runs will fail on windows when updating to cookbook versions `>=3.4.0`. `>=2.20.0`
if:
- Any of the blacklisted Datadog Agent versions (`6.14.0` or `6.14.1`) has been pinned in `agent6_version`.
- No Agent version is specified in the `agent6_version` attribute (defaulting to `6.14.1` at the
time of this writing)

After uploading the latest datadog cookbook to your Chef Server and ensuring the cookbook has been
propagated to all nodes, upgrade the Agent version to `6.14.2` by setting the `agent6_version` attribute.

If you are updating from **6.14.0 or 6.14.1 on Windows**, we **strongly** recommend following these steps:

1. Install the latest datadog cookbook on your Chef Server (`>=3.4.0` or `>=2.20.0`)
2. Remove ALL prior versions of the datadog cookbook to ensure only the latest version of the cookbook
is available to your hosts. Please make sure to backup any modified or forked versions of the datadog
cookbook using `knife` or `berks` if you need to reference them later.
3. Set the `agent6_version` attribute to `6.14.2`

**PLEASE NOTE:** It is important to ensure that your hosts ONLY use the latest version of the 
datadog cookbook (`>=3.4.0` or `>=2.20.0`), before setting the `agent6_version` attribute. This is a
precaution to ensure older versions of the datadog cookbook do not trigger the uninstall bug.

To learn more about this bug, please read [here](http://dtdg.co/win-614-fix).

Recipes
=======

default
-------
Just a placeholder for now, when we have more shared components they will probably live there.

dd-agent
--------
Installs the Datadog agent on the target system, sets the API key, and start the service to report on the local system metrics

**Notes for Windows**:

* With Chef >= 12.6 _and_ the `windows` cookbook >= 1.39.0, Agent upgrades are known to fail.
  For Chef>=12.6 users on Windows, we recommend pinning the `windows` cookbook to a lower version (`~> 1.38.0` for instance).

  If that's not an option, a known workaround is to use the `remove-dd-agent` recipe (since the `2.5.0` version of the present cookbook) to uninstall the Agent
  prior to any Agent upgrade.

* Because of changes in the Windows Agent packaging and install in version 5.12.0, when upgrading the Agent from versions <= 5.10.1 to versions >= 5.12.0,
  please set the `windows_agent_use_exe` attribute to `true`.

  Once the upgrade is complete, you can leave the attribute to its default value (`false`).

  For more information on these Windows packaging changes, see the related [docs on the dd-agent wiki](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Windows-Agent-Installation).

dd-handler
----------
Installs the [chef-handler-datadog](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-handler-datadog) gem and invokes the handler at the end of a Chef run to report the details back to the newsfeed.

dogstatsd-(python|ruby)
-----------------------
Installs the language-specific libraries to interact with `dogstatsd`.

* Note for Chef >= 13 users: the `datadog::dogstatsd-python` recipe is not compatible with Chef >= 13, as it relies on a resource that was removed in Chef 13.0.
  To install the `dogstatsd-python` library with Chef, please add a dependency on the `poise-python` cookbook to your custom/wrapper cookbook, and use the following resource:
  ```ruby
  python_package 'dogstatsd-python' # assumes that python and pip are installed
  ```
  For more advanced usage, please refer to the [`poise-python` cookbook documentation](https://github.com/poise/poise-python)

ddtrace-(python|ruby)
---------------------
Installs the language-specific libraries for application Traces (APM).

* Note for Chef >= 13 users: the `datadog::ddtrace-python` recipe is not compatible with Chef >= 13, as it relies on a resource that was removed in Chef 13.0.
  To install the `ddtrace-python` library with Chef, please add a dependency on the `poise-python` cookbook to your custom/wrapper cookbook, and use the following resource:
  ```ruby
  python_package 'ddtrace' # assumes that python and pip are installed
  ```
  For more advanced usage, please refer to the [`poise-python` cookbook documentation](https://github.com/poise/poise-python)

other
-----
There are many other integration-specific recipes, that are meant to assist in deploying the correct agent configuration files and dependencies for a given integration.

Resources
=========

datadog_monitor
---------------

The `datadog_monitor` resource will help you to enable Agent integrations.

The default action `:add` enables the integration by filling a configuration file for the integration with the values provided to the resource, setting the correct permissions on that file, and restarting the Agent.

The `:remove` action disables an integration.

### Syntax

```ruby
datadog_monitor 'name' do
  init_config                       Hash # default value: {}
  instances                         Array # default value: []
  logs                              Array # default value: []
  use_integration_template          true, false # default value: false
  action                            Symbol # defaults to :add if not specified
end
```

#### Actions

* `:add` Default. Enable the integration.
* `:remove` Use this action to disable the integration.

#### Properties

* `'name'` is the name of the Agent integration to configure and enable
* `instances` are the fields used to fill values under the `instances` section in the integration configuration file.
* `init_config` are the fields used to fill values under the the `init_config` section in the integration configuration file.
* `logs` are the fields used to fill values under the the `logs` section in the integration configuration file.
* `use_integration_template`: set to `true` (recommended) to use a default template that simply writes the values of `instances`, `init_config`and `logs` in YAML under their respective YAML keys. (defaults to `false` for backward compatibility, will default to `true` in a future major version of the cookbook)

### Example

This example enables the ElasticSearch integration by using the `datadog_monitor` resource. It provides the instance configuration (in this case: the url to connect to ElasticSearch) and set the `use_integration_template` flag to use the default configuration template.

Note that the Agent installation needs to be earlier in the run list.

```ruby
include_recipe 'datadog::dd-agent'

datadog_monitor 'elastic'
  instances  [{'url' => 'http://localhost:9200'}]
  use_integration_template true
end
```

See `recipes/` for many examples using the `datadog_monitor` resource.

Usage
=====

### Agent 6 Support
Please note the cookbook now supports installing both Agent v5 and Agent v6 of the Datadog Agent on Linux (since v2.14.0) and Windows (since v2.15.0). By default versions `<=2.x` of the cookbook will default to install Agent5, you may however override this behavior with the `node['datadog']['agent6']` attribute.
  ```
  default_attributes(
    'datadog' => {
      'agent6' => true
    }
  )
  ```

Note: to _upgrade_ to Agent 6 on a node with Agent 5 already installed, you also have to pin `agent6_version` to a v6 version (recommended), or set `agent6_package_action` to `'upgrade'`.

Additional attributes are available to have finer control over how you install Agent 6. These are Agent 6 counterparts to several well known Agent 5 attributes (code [here](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L31-L75)):
 * `agent6_version`: allows you to pin the agent version (recommended).
 * `agent6_package_action`: defaults to `'install'`, may be set to `'upgrade'` to automatically upgrade to latest (not recommended, we recommend pinning to a version with `agent6_version` and change that version to upgrade).
 * `agent6_aptrepo`: desired APT repo for the agent. Defaults to `http://apt.datadoghq.com`
 * `agent6_aptrepo_dist`: desired distribution for the APT repo. Defaults to `stable`
 * `agent6_yumrepo`: desired YUM repo for the agent. Defaults to `https://yum.datadoghq.com/stable/6/x86_64/`

Please review the [attributes/default.rb](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog/blob/master/attributes/default.rb) file (at the version of the cookbook you use) for the list and usage of the attributes used by the cookbook.

For general information on the Datadog Agent 6, please refer to the [datadog-agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/) repo.

#### Windows Agent v6 installation

Starting with version `>= 6.11`, the Windows Agent v6 must be installed with datadog
cookbook version `>= 2.18.0`.

This is due to the Agent v6 running with an unprivileged user on Windows
since 6.11. However, prior to 2.18.0, the datadog cookbook was enforcing
Administrators privileges to the Datadog Agent directories and files.

### Extra configuration

Should you wish to add additional elements to the Agent v6 configuration file
(typically `datadog.yaml`) that are not directly available
as attributes of the cookbook, you may use the `node['datadog']['extra_config']`
attribute. This attribute is a hash and will be marshaled into the configuration
file accordingly.

E.g.

 ```
 default_attributes(
   'datadog' => {
     'extra_config' => {
        'secret_backend_command' => '/sbin/local-secrets'
     }
   }
 )
 ```

This example will set the field `secret_backend_command` in the configuration
file `datadog.yaml`.

### Instructions

1. Add this cookbook to your Chef Server, either by installing with knife or by adding it to your Berksfile:
  ```
  cookbook 'datadog', '~> 2.20.0'
  ```
2. Add your API Key either:
  * as a node attribute via an `environment` or `role`, or
  * as a node attribute by declaring it in another cookbook at a higher precedence level, or
  * in the node `run_state` by setting `node.run_state['datadog']['api_key']` in another cookbook preceding `datadog`'s recipes in the run_list. This approach has the benefit of not storing the credential in clear text on the Chef Server.
3. Create an 'application key' for `chef_handler` [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api), and add it as a node attribute or in the run state, as in Step #2.

   NB: if you're using the run state to store the api and app keys you need to set them at compile time before `datadog::dd-handler` in the run list.

4. Enable Agent integrations by including their recipes and configuration details in your role’s run-list and attributes.
   Note that you can also create additional integrations recipes by using the `datadog_monitor` resource.
5. Associate the recipes with the desired `roles`, i.e. "role:chef-client" should contain "datadog::dd-handler" and a "role:base" should start the agent with "datadog::dd-agent". Here's an example role with both recipes plus the MongoDB integration enabled.
  ```
  name 'example'
  description 'Example role using DataDog'

  default_attributes(
    'datadog' => {
      'agent6' => true,
      'api_key' => 'api_key',
      'application_key' => 'app_key',
      'agent6_version' => {
        'debian' => '1:6.14.2-1',
        'rhel' => '6.14.2-1',
        'windows' => '6.14.2'
      },
      'mongo' => {
        'instances' => [
          {'host' => 'localhost', 'port' => '27017'}
        ]
      }
    }
  )

  run_list %w(
    recipe[datadog::dd-agent]
    recipe[datadog::dd-handler]
    recipe[datadog::mongo]
  )
  ```
  NB: set the `agent6` attribute to `false` in the `datadog` hash if you'd like to install Agent v5.

6. Wait until `chef-client` runs on the target node (or trigger chef-client manually if you're impatient)

We are not making use of data_bags in this recipe at this time, as it is unlikely that you will have more than one API key and one application key.
